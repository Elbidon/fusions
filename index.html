The earrings can grant the wearer certain privileges, such as using the Time Rings that are exclusive to Supreme Kais. The earrings also have the ability to fuse two people into a single entity for an hour, although it is permanent if a Supreme Kai is involved. <img src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/84dc13b7-a2e7-4b45-83ec-311e72e82900/dd22fue-a6552a21-d0f7-4aba-b570-3183301551a6.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzg0ZGMxM2I3LWEyZTctNGI0NS04M2VjLTMxMWU3MmU4MjkwMFwvZGQyMmZ1ZS1hNjU1MmEyMS1kMGY3LTRhYmEtYjU3MC0zMTgzMzAxNTUxYTYucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.fjA4CML4A-emtthBVCOh6TUvR8B23p98C4TARVvy7YQ" width="100px" height="100px"/> </p>
            <h2 id="fusiondance" style="text-align:center;color: orange">The Fusion Dance (フュージョン Fyūjon)</h2> <p style="font-size:20px">is a technique invented by the Metamorans to temporarily merge two or more bodies into a single, superior entity. The technique is introduced by Goku, who learned it from the Metamorans while in the Other World.The technique is most commonly used by Goten and Trunks in order to create Gotenks. Later, it is used by Goku and Vegeta to create Gogeta. <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a2/Fusion-Dance-in-Dragonball-Z-%28Video-Game%29-Final.jpg/aid317870-v4-1200px-Fusion-Dance-in-Dragonball-Z-%28Video-Game%29-Final.jpg" width="100px" height="100px"/></p>

            <p style="font-size:20px">also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga, is the resulting fusion between Goku and Vegeta by the use of the Potara earrings. Vegito wields tremendous power, and like his Fusion Dance counterpart Gogeta, he is regarded as one of the mightiest warriors in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.Vegito first appeared at the end of "Union of Rivals" to start battling with Super Buu, with his second appearance in the next episode "Meet Vegito" as the main protagonist throughout the entire episode. His debut in Dragon Ball Super was many years later to fight and attempt to defeat Fused Zamasu, though they quickly defused due to over-usage of power.</p>
             <h2 id="gogeta" style="text-align:center;color: orange"> <img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/10/d1222-17298412350592-1920.jpg?w=640"height="100px"/> Gogeta (ゴジータ Gojīta) </h2> <p style="font-size:20px">is the Metamoran fusion of Goku and Vegeta when they perform the Fusion Dance properly. Wielding the combined and magnified strength of both Goku and Vegeta, Gogeta is an incredibly deadly warrior, and like his Potara counterpart Vegito, he is regarded as one of the most powerful characters in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.Gogeta first debuted in Fusion Reborn as the final protagonist when Goku and Vegeta fused in Hell to defeat Super Janemba. He returned in Dragon Ball GT as a Super Saiyan 4 to battle Omega Shenron, but defused quicker than expected due to over-using too much power. He would then make his canonical debut in Broly as the film's final protagonist, similar to his role from Fusion Reborn. </p>
